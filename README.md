# StickO-Note
StickO-Note is a sticky note program written in Odin. It is *very much* a WIP at the time of writing.

Planned features are:
* Sticky notes:
  * A sticky note can be arbitrarily dimensioned
  * You can set the color of the sticky note
  * You can write text on a sticky note
  * Ability to change color, font, size, etc.
  * (Maybe the ability embed images and other content at some point)
* Canvases:
  * A canvas is an infinite plane you can move around in
  * A canvas can have an arbitrary number of sticky notes
  * You can have many canvases
  * A canvas can be opened in a separate process/window
* ***Ability to hide process from Alt+Tab switcher!!!***
  * For Linux users, your mileage may vary depending on which desktop environment you use

The last point is what motivated me to create StickO-Note in the first place.
The Microsoft sticky note program does not have this feature (as far as I'm aware at the time of writing),
so every sticky note you have is another window you must Alt+Tab through. As far as I'm concerned,
this makes the program practically unusable. Alt+Tab is such an important function that unnecessarily
cluttering the menu is criminally poor design. So, not doing that is pretty much the main feature StickO-Note.
